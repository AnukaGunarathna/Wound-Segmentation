"""
Model architecture and loader for binary wound segmentation using U-Net with EfficientNetB3 encoder.

This module defines the core deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation. It includes:
- A function to construct a U-Net-style model using EfficientNetB3 as the encoder.
- A loader function that optionally loads pretrained weights into the model.

Functions
---------
- segmentation_model : Builds the segmentation model with skip connections and transposed
convolutions.
- load_segmentation_model : Loads the model with optional pretrained weights for inference
or fine-tuning.

Typical use
-----------
Used both for training and inference stages. The architecture is designed for detecting
wound areas in RGB images, and the loader supports loading '.weights.h5' weights
files for quick deployment.

    Build a U-Net style binary segmentation model with EfficientNetB3 as the encoder.

    This function builds a deep convolutional neural network model for semantic segmentation of
    images. The encoder is constructed using EfficientNetB3 model (without the top classification
    layer and without ImageNet pretrained weights) while the decoder block uses transpose
    convolutions and skip connections to upsample the feature maps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_shape : tuple
        Dimensions of the input RGB image, default (512, 512, 3)

    Returns
    -------
    tf.keras.Model
        A Keras model that maps input RGB images to binary masks with values in [0, 1]
        using sigmoid activation.

    Raises
